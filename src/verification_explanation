STATIC:

e = private key (single 256-bit number)
P = Public key (x,y coordinate, each 256bit)
e * G = P where G is the generator point of secp256k1

SIGNATURE-RELATED:

k * G = R where k is random 256bit number
Rx is the only one we care about.
r = Rx
u,v - cannot be 0, caluculated using s
u = z/s
v = r/s

HASH-RELATED:

z = signature hash (hash256 aka 2x SHA256) on the document
s = (z + re)/k (calculate u, v using s)
Verification algo
uG + vP = (r,y)
